# Remote Dev

Virtual Dev Environments over Visual Code for your remote teams

Discuss: 

Remote Dev allow us to share different OS or/and application environments removing the need to install their components in our team's local machines.

It does that by creating Docker containers that include applications, extensions, any config files or source code.

### Main use cases

- **Stand-Alone Dev Sandboxes**
  We might need to isolate our building and runtime enviromnet from our local environment;

Mabye because we want to test on a production like environment
or there might be some conflicts between platforms that stop us working locally,
or to avoid dealing with multiple platform dependent frameworks. Say you develop on Mac or Windows and runtime env is on Linux.

In any case, the point is, _write once, run everywhere_

- **Container based applications**
  If you are developing an application to run on containers you might want to develop directly over a container, closer to live environment
